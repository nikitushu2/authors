This project is a GraphQL API for a book library system built with Node.js, Apollo Server, and MongoDB. It provides functionality to manage authors and books, including querying for books by author or genre, adding new books, editing author information, and user authentication. The API supports real-time updates through GraphQL subscriptions, allowing clients to be notified when new books are added. Users can create accounts with a favorite genre, log in with JWT authentication, and access personalized features.
